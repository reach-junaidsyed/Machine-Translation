# Machine-Translation

This project is an implementation of machine translation from German to English and vice versa. It has been implemented for me to gain a better understanding of Machine Translation. The project heavily borrows code the reference below with minor modifications. The data set used is the Multi30k dataset. This is a dataset with ~30,000 parallel English, German and French sentences, each with ~12 words per sentence.
